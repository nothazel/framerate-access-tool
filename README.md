# framerate-access-tool
Allows the user to access their computer's full framerate potential.

To set up the tool, create a folder and add a "ClientSettings" folder within it. Place the provided Visual Basic Script in the same folder as "ClientSettings". Once done, simply run the Visual Basic Script, and you're all set.

Please note that this method assumes your Roblox is located in the default setup location, as the destination folder is hardcoded.
