# framerate-access-tool

WARNING: THIS IS FOR ROBLOX.

Allows the user to access their computer's full framerate potential.

To set up the tool, put the files in a folder and just run the py file and you are all set.
You will need to run the py file again whenever roblox updates as roblox update clears any files that are not roblox's files.

Please note that this method assumes your Roblox is located in the default setup location, as the destination folder is hardcoded.
